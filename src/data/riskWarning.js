  <p>
    Monieworx does not, directly, or indirectly, guarantee or make any representation or warranty
    concerning the completeness, adequacy or accuracy of this risk disclosures notice. This brief
    statement does not disclose all of the risks and other significant aspects of investing.
    You should, therefore, carefully study and consider the merits and demerits and seek independent
    professional advice before making any investment decisions.
  </p>
  <p>
    A decision to invest is a personal decision by you and no responsibility for the consequences of
    that decision is accepted by Monieworx or by any of its directors, agents, employees or other
    members.
  </p>
  <p>
    To invest through the Portal you need to understand the following:

      <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 500;">APPROPRIATENESS</h2>
      <p>
        Before opening an account for you, we are required to make an assessment of whether it is
        appropriate for you, and to warn you, on the basis of the information you provide to us,
        whether the services offered by us are appropriate for you. Any decision on whether or not
        to open an account, and on whether or not you understand the risks, is yours.

    </li>
    <li>
      <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 500;">STATUS OF YOUR INVESTMENT</h2>
      <p>
        Investments in startups, early-stage ventures, emerging technology companies funds, 
        SME businesses, and digital asset projects (<b>Fundraisers</b>) are unpredictable and carry 
        high risks as well as the possibility of high rewards. Unlike an investment in a mature 
        business, where there is a track record of revenue and income, the success of a 
        startup, early-stage venture or emerging technology company often relies on the 
        development of a new product or service that may or may not find a market. You 
        should be prepared to lose your entire investment.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important that each investor carefully considers whether such investments are 
        suitable based on their personal circumstances, commitments, and available financial 
        resources. Monieworx does not guarantee any return on investment or the 
        maintenance of the value of any investment. Engaging in investment activities always 
        involves a significant risk of losing your investment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the fundraising companies listed on Monieworx are SME businesses, new 
        companies with a limited track record. While these companies provide information 
        such as their business plan and financial forecasts, it's important to note that these 
        documents are not guarantees that the company will achieve what it hopes to do. 
        Additionally, the information provided may include certain facts and statements, but 
        Monieworx is not responsible for verifying the accuracy of these statements.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a company you invest defaults, Monieworx will <b>NOT</b> reimburse your investment and 
        you will not be entitled to claim from the National Investor Protection Fund.

      <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 500;">RISKS</h2>
      <p><b>- Credit Risk:</b></p>
      <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha; padding-inline-start:20px">
        <li>
          The Fundraisers' ability to repay the loan is subject to various factors, including 
          their financial condition, business performance, and market conditions. There is a 
          risk that the Fundraisers may default on their loan obligation, leading to a partial 
          or total loss of your investment.
        </li>
        <li>
          The creditworthiness and financial stability of the Fundraiser may change over 
          time, affecting their ability to repay the loan. This may increase the risk of default 
          and adversely impact your investment.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>- Platform Risk:</b></p>
      <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha; padding-inline-start:20px">
        <li>
          The Platform acts as an intermediary between Fundraisers and you. There is a risk 
          that the Platform may face operational or technical issues, including but not 
          limited to system failures, cyber-attacks, or data breaches, which may impact the 
          Platform's ability to perform its functions effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Platform may also face legal, regulatory, or compliance risks that could affect 
          its operations or the viability of the investment opportunities available on the 
          Platform.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Platform may suspend or terminate its services, which may impact your ability 
          to access your investments or recover your funds.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>- Market and Economic Risks:</b></p>
      <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha; padding-inline-start:20px">
        <li>
          Investments in debt-based crowdfunding opportunities are subject to market and 
          economic risks. Changes in market conditions, interest rates, inflation rates, or 
          other economic factors may affect the performance and value of your 
          investments.
        </li>
        <li>
          The overall economic and financial conditions can influence the Fundraiser's 
          ability to repay the loan. Economic downturns or adverse events may lead to 
          higher default rates and decreased recovery rates, negatively impacting your 
          investment.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>- The Need for Diversification - Not Putting Your Eggs in one Basket</b></p>
      <p>
        To minimize the risks outlined earlier, it is highly advised that investors distribute their 
        investment across different debt-based crowdfunding opportunities to reduce the 
        risk of concentration. Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against 
        losses, but it can help mitigate the impact of any individual investment's poor 
        performance.
      </p>

      <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 500;">RELIANCE ON INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>
        The information provided on the platform, including the Fundraiser's financial 
        statements, business plans, and other data, is based on the information available at 
        the time. There is a risk that the information provided may be incomplete, inaccurate,

        crowdfunding investments. You should carefully review all the relevant 
        information provided on the platform and consult with your own financial advisor

    <li>
      <h2 style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: 500;">NO ESTABLISHED MARKET - LACK OF LIQUIDITY</h2>
      <p>
        As an investor, your ability to resell your investment may be restricted with narrow 
        exceptions. You should be aware that no established market exists for the trading of 
        debt securities issued by private companies (which the companies that are listed on 
        the Portal are), and such investments are not easily realisable as such, you may need 
        to hold your investment for an indefinite period of time. There may also be a 
        restriction on your ability to sell your investment. It must be appreciated that there 
        could be difficulty in selling such investments at a reasonable price and, in some 
        circumstances, it may be difficult to sell them at any price.
